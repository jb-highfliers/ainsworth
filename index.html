		<h2>About Ainsworth English Wines</h2>
		<p style="color:gold; text-decoration:bold">In 2018, after one of the hottest summers on record, brothers Ben and Jeremy Brown realised that the time had come. English wines - once a thing of mere mythology - were here to stay. And so they decided to celebrate them accordingly, setting out on a mission to introduce them to the nation. And so <b>Ainsworth English Wines</b> was born...</p>

		<h2>Our Mission Statement</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>To celebrate the best of English wines</li>
			<li>To go above-and-beyond with our recommendations: we are sommeliers, not just salespeople</li>
			<li>To make our system as easy-to-use as possible</li>
		</ol>
